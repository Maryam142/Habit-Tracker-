 A habit tracker prototype app is a mobile application designed to help users develop and maintain good habits. The app allows users to set goals, track their progress, and receive notifications to remind them to perform their desired habit on a regular basis.

The app typically includes a dashboard that provides a visual representation of the user's progress, allowing them to see how well they are sticking to their goals. Users can customize their goals and habits based on their personal preferences and needs.

The app also provides insights and analytics to help users understand their habits better, such as how often they are completing their desired habit and what times of day they are most likely to do so. This information can help users make more informed decisions about how to improve their habits and achieve their goals.
